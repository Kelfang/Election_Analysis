# Election Analysis


## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to assist the Colorado Board of Elections with their election audit by counting the votes and determining the winner of a congressional race.

1.	Determine the total number of votes that were casted.
2.	Identify the list of candidates who received votes.
3.	Count the total number of votes each candidate received.
4.	Identify the percentage of votes that each candidate won.
5.	Name the winner of the election based on the popular vote.


## Resources
- Software: Python, Visual Studio Code

- Data Source: election_results.csv


## Summary

## Challenge Overview
The most important aspect was to maintain the integrity of the data; to ensure that each vote was counted and counted correctly. 


## Challenge Summary
This was a straightforward assignment that did not pose any significant challenges. By using Python and Visual Studio Code, we were able to read the data and process the counts with 100% accuracy. In addition, these resources generated the outcome immediately and the code easily outlines the steps taken to retrieve the results. This kind of transparency is imperative when auditing election results.
